A tracker of the bus stops from MIT to Harvard University

Description:
The index.html file will pull up a map on your browser with a marker that will give you your starting location.  You will click the the 'Show Stops between MIT and Harvard' button and the marker will move through the bus stop coordinates to the final destination. 

How To Run:
In your index.html file you will need to link your JavaScript/js file and your css style sheet.  You will also need to go to mapbox and create your own unique token.  Make sure to link the version of mapbox you want to run in your js file as well as the Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the bus stops.

Improvements:
I would like the bus tracker marker to show the actual name of the bus stops as it moves across the map.  This will add better clarity to the map.  The pop up function of the names would be styled in the css file and the actual logic would be created with functions etc. in the js file.
